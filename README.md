# Richard Malka's Pleading
English Translation of Richard Malka's Pleading at the Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Cacher Trial in December 4, 2020

## Description
The trial of Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Cacher attacks concluded in December 4, 2020, with the pleading of lawyer Richard Malka, who legally represents the paper since the 1990's. Hailed as an important document for the recent history of France, the pleading briefly retraces the history of the paper since its inception and with a particular emphasis on the controversy surrounding the caricatures of prophet Muhammad. 

## Translation
I made this translation, because nobody seems to have done it before, and because I believe the document should be accessible to a broader non-French speaking audience. As a historian myself, I believe people should be able to read the primary source documents that shape our history, including recent ones. The translation was done during my spare time, and on a personal basis. I tried to remain as faithful as possible to the original speech. I have changed the passive voice into an active one as much as possible, and I converted the narrative present into imperfect tense. There might be a few mistakes. If that is the case, please feel free to submit an issue on GitHub.

The translation is licenced as CC0 1.0 Universal, unless the author of the speech thinks otherwise.
